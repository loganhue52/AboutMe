## Summary

My name is Logan Fehn. I am a student at F.J. Reitz High School and the Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center. I work a part time job at walmart as a Food and Consumables Team Associate. When I am older, I wish to work a software developer to fund my hobby of modifying and building cars which would knock out two birds with one line of code.
